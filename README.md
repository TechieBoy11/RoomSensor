# RoomSensor
## Description
This is a personal IoT project that automates room lighting using motion detection and voice assistant integration. Built with an Arduino R4 WiFi, the system detects movement and communicates with Alexa to control smart devices in real time. The goal is to create a seamless, hands-free lighting experience when entering or leaving a room. It showcases embedded systems, cloud connectivity (via Arduino IoT Cloud), and smart home integration.
